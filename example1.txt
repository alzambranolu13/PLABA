Step 3: " The purpose of this study was to evaluate how well the fovea repaired itself and the association between restoration of the tissue at the back of the eye that captures images and vision clarity following reattachment surgery for rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) which is a tear in the retina leads to fluid accumulation which separates the retina from the underlying tissues"
